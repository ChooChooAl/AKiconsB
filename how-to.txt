This seems how I did it.   I was going by the seat of my pants.


Making a Curors repository I did the following.
mkdir Cursors
cd Cursors
git init
Created README.md
git add README.md
git add AKcursors.blk
git add AKcursors.hour
git add AKcursors.spinner
git commit -m "New Repository"
(not sure about the order of the next two items.)
git branch -M master
git remote add origin https://github.com/ChooChooAl/Cursors.git

git push -u origin master
    enter login/password for github.
